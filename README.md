## Hi, I’m Dale—a lifelong builder with a passion for creating both hardware and software.

After a decade of building hardware professionally, I decided to pivot in 2022 to focusing full-time on software development and I began working at CACI as a software engineer on defense and intelligence projects. At night I work in my home shop on my own ideas--sometimes hardware, sometimes software--but always centered around making useful things for myself, friends, or local business.

Things I'm currently working on:
- A stock portfolio balancing tool
- Adding better unit tests to my frontend code
- Learning more about deploying projects with cloud infrastructure, especially infrastructure as code
